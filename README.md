# H2No
NoSQL On Top of PASM (Fastest PHP framework)
---------------
This is a Simple CRUD based NoSQL framework.
It is has a very simple, easy, and basic usage.
It is a very good way to access and retrieve NoSQL database
information in Serialized formats.

# Underlying Code
---------------
The underlying code is just that of PASM. PASM
is a replica of Oracle ASM language in its entirety.
The language is fully loaded and nearly exact in
calling methods. It is extremely fast, and will
take your next project to the next level.
I am very pleased of the PASM results I was able to
accomplish when I started and finished the project.
